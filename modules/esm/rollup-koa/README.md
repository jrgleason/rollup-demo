# Basic example of modern UI development using Rollup

## TLDR

1. `npm run rollup:watch`
1. `npm start`

## Why Rollup?

It would be nice to do this without any precompile at all, however, libraries like material-web do not provide ESM bundles yet. Rollup resolves this nicely.

## TODO

1. Testing
1. More Documentation
